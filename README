To Install Dave:
===================
Make sure your system has 'curl' installed and obtain Rust using your command line or Windows PowerShell.
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Go into the project directory and build the project from source using cargo after Rust has been installed.
$ cargo clean && cargo update && cargo build && cargo build --release

A binary executable will now exist for your current system. You can find the release binary at 'target/release/dave'.

Alternatively, running 'cargo run' in the project directory will run the program in debug mode.

To build an executable for Windows when building on Linux run the following commands.
$ cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu && cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

To Run Dave:
===============
For now, use the release binary in '{PROJECT_DIR}/target/release/dave'.
Run 'dave --help' to get started, or copy the 'dave' binary to '/usr/bin'.

Dave Land!
=============
Run these commands when creating a new dave_land PNG map image after changing locations or 
creating new ones or altering connections for locations or possible pathways between locations.

$ cd dave_land_map
$ awk -f dave_map.awk ../dave_land_file.ron > map.gv
$ dot -Tpng -o dave_map.png map.gv
$ cd ../

Dave Chip8 Emulator!
=======================
The 'l', '↓'' and '↑'' are new keys only for the emulator:

- The 'l' key switches between having the emulator fill the whole terminal or being confined to the resolution of the original Chip8 screen
- The ↓ Decrements the Number of Opcodes Per CPU Cycle
- The ↑ Increments the Number of Opcodes Per CPU Cycle
- The ← Decrements the Number of Hz Per CPU Cycle
- The → Increments the Number of Hz Per CPU Cycle
