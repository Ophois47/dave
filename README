To Install Dave:
===================
Make sure your system has 'curl' installed and obtain Rust using your command line or Windows PowerShell.
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Go into the project directory and build the project from source using cargo after Rust has been installed.
$ cargo clean && cargo update && cargo build && cargo build --release

A binary executable will now exist for your current system. You can find the release binary at 'target/release/dave'.

Alternatively, running 'cargo run' in the project directory will run the program in debug mode.

To build on an executable for Windows when building on Linux run the following commands.
$ cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu && cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

To Run Dave:
===============
For now, use the release binary in '{PROJECT_DIR}/target/release/dave'.
Run 'dave --help' to get started, or copy the 'dave' binary to '/usr/bin'.
